# Welcome to my research website

The main focus of my PhD. work is on _runtime enforcement of non-safety policies on distributed systems_.

As Fred Schneider once wrote [#1]:

> "A formal characterization of what can and cannot be accomplished using mechanisms in EM has both practical and theoretical utility. Clearly, such a characterization can inform system buildersâ€™ selections of enforcement mechanisms by circumscribing the intrinsic limits of reference monitors and derivative mechanisms. From a theoretical perspective, the characterization constitutes a first step towards a taxonomy of security policies that is based on a mathematical semantics of programs."

I am in the process of developing a unified and generalized model of runtime enforcement that overcomes the limitations of previously proposed models.

Previously, I studied static analysis methods for verification of authentication protocols [#2]. 
In particular, I analyzed and compared model checking and theorem proving, and developed a framework for verification of security protocols using the theorem prover Coq [#3].
